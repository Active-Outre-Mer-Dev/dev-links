# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Developper Essentials

Here are some tools that are considered essential for every developer. Here are a few of the necessary tools for every developer:

### Text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 

    A text editor or IDE is where developers write, edit, and manage their code. Some popular text editors and IDEs include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and IntelliJ IDEA.

### Version Control System (VCS) 

    A VCS helps developers track changes to their code over time and collaborate with other team members. Git is one of the most popular VCSs used by developers today.

### Command Line Interface (CLI) 

    The CLI is a text-based interface used to enter commands to interact with a computer's operating system. It is an essential tool for developers who need to perform tasks that aren't available through graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

### Web Browser 

    A web browser is used to test and debug web applications during development. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are popular web browsers used by developers.

### Debugging tools 

    Debugging tools help developers identify and fix errors in their code. Chrome DevTools and Firefox Developer Tools are popular debugging tools.

### Package manager 

    A package manager helps manage dependencies in a project. Popular package managers for JavaScript include npm and Yarn.

### Task runner or build tool 

    A task runner or build tool automates repetitive tasks in a project, such as compiling code or compressing files. Some popular tools include Grunt, Gulp, and webpack.

### Code libraries and frameworks 

    Code libraries and frameworks help developers write code more efficiently by providing pre-written code for common tasks. Popular libraries and frameworks include jQuery, React, and Angular (You can find a few links redirecting to said libraries in the lower section of this document).

These tools are essential for developers, and they can help increase productivity, simplify workflows, and improve code quality.
